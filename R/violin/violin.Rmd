### Violin plot with ggplot
```{r vis_vio, warning=FALSE}
violin <- ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_violin(aes(x = species, 
                  y = bill_length_mm, 
                  fill = island)) 

violin
```

### Notes
- **Violins** are particularly adapted when the amount of **data is huge** and showing individual observations gets impossible. For **small datasets**, a **boxplot with jitter** is probably a better option since it really shows all the information.
